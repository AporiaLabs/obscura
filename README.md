# Obscura: Protect Your Attention

![Obscura Logo](icons/vz_500.png)

Obscura is a browser extension that filters online content based on your long-term goals to protect your attention from distractions and low-value content.

## Overview

In an age of information overload and AI-generated content, Obscura acts as your personal content filter, analyzing web content in real-time and hiding items that don't align with your goals and interests. By leveraging AI to fight AI, Obscura helps you stay focused on what truly matters to you.

## Features

- **Goal-Based Filtering**: Define your long-term goals and interests, and Obscura will filter content accordingly
- **Platform Support**:
  - âœ… YouTube: Filter videos based on title and channel
  - ðŸ”„ Twitter/X: Filter tweets (under development)
  - ðŸ”„ Reddit: Filter posts (under development)
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Platform-specific content preferences
  - Adjustable probability threshold for filtering
  - Enable/disable filtering per platform
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear visual feedback when content is being analyzed or has been filtered

## How It Works

1. You define your goals and content preferences in the extension settings
2. When you browse supported websites, Obscura analyzes content in real-time

## Philosophy

Obscura was created with a mission to protect human attention in an increasingly AI-dominated world. The project believes that:

1. The greatest threat to our potential is the capture of our attention by hyper-stimulating content
2. AI can be used to protect against this threat by filtering content based on our true goals
3. By being intentional about what we consume online, we can focus on what truly matters
